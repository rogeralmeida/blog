      <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">Coding Dojo</a> is a group of developers who meet regularly to practice their
      craft. We meet in a conference room, bring our laptops, and work on a programming challenge. We have a projector
      and
      everyone takes turns at the keyboard. We discuss the problem and different approaches. We learn from each other
      and
      have fun.
